            "The 'Business of Art' is very different from the 'Art Of Business'. In todays' digital era, successful artists are those who know both. We happen to understand both the fields to quite some extent, hence we try to bring our education and experience to work by supporting talents whom we believe in. We are confident of growing symbiotically and respectfully, if we look at things with a long term perspective, and work with honesty, integrity and a masterplan."
